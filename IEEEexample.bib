pages={234-237}, 
abstract={This paper presents the optimal dispatch for the under load tap changer (ULTC) of a substation transformer, substation capacitors, and feeder capacitors for volt/VAr control in a distribution system. Three objectives of interest in the problem consist of energy loss, total capacitor kVAr to be switched on, and total number of daily switching operations of the ULTC and all capacitors. The optimization problem is subjected to power flow equations, voltage limits, and maximum switching operations for the ULTC and the capacitors. All the objectives are fuzzified using a trapezoidal membership function and are integrated to represent the fuzzy decision value. Fuzzy multiobjective and particle swarm optimization are employed to determine the optimal dispatch schedule that provides the best compromise among all the objectives. The methodology is demonstrated by a 29-bus distribution system of Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), Thailand.},

abstract={The optimal scheduling of load tap changers (LTCs) and switched shunt capacitors for simultaneously minimizing energy loss and improving voltage profile while taking harmonics into account is performed using evolutionary-based algorithms (EAs). The proposed algorithm is capable of optimizing large distribution systems with different types of nonlinear loads. The decouple approach is employed for harmonic power-flow calculations, while two EAs are developed to determine the load interval division and near-optimal schedule. The inclusion of harmonics provides the optimization benefits while maintaining the acceptable distortion levels. The scheduling is carried out for the IEEE 123-bus with 14 shunt capacitors and 12 nonlinear loads. The main contributions are inclusion of harmonics in the optimal scheduling problem and its application to large distribution systems with multiple nonlinear loads.},

year={2002},

pages={1068-1072}, 
abstract={Reactive power optimization with time-varying load demand in distribution systems is investigated in this paper. The objective of this paper is to determine the proper setting values of capacitor banks and transformer taps for the 24 h in the next day. A heuristic and algorithmic combined approach is proposed in this paper. The approach simplifies the mathematical model of the daily setting values of reactive power/voltage control devices, solves the temporal optimization of each control device by heuristic rules, and then converts the optimization model with time-varying load into the same one as conventional optimization model with constant load. Therefore, the algorithms applied to the conventional optimization model can be easily used to solve the optimization model with time-varying load demand. Results from numerical examples show that a proper dispatch schedule for capacitor banks and transformer taps can be reached by this approach efficiently.},

title={Fuzzy-based reactive power and voltage control in a distribution system}, 
year={2003}, 
volume={18}, 
number={2}, 
pages={610-618}, 
abstract={This paper presents fuzzy-based reactive power and voltage control in a distribution system. The main purpose is to find the combination of main transformer load tap changer (LTC) positions and capacitors on/off switching operations in a day, such that the voltage deviations at the secondary bus of main transformer become as small as possible, while the reactive power flows through the main transformer and the real power losses at feeders become as little as possible. To minimize system repair cost, the total number of switching operations of LTC and capacitors in a day must be kept as few as possible. From the descriptions above, the linguistic expressions such as "as small as possible," "as little as possible," and "as few as possible" are not clear. So in this paper, the reactive power and voltage control problem is first formulated with fuzzy sets then an annealing searching technique is used to find a proper combination of LTC positions and capacitors on/off switching operations in a day. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, reactive power and voltage control in a distribution system within the service area of Yunlin District Office of Taiwan Power Company (TPC) are analyzed. It is found that a proper dispatching schedule for LTC positions and capacitors switching operations can be reached by the proposed method.},
